# Repository Overviews & Usage Steps

This documentation provides a brief overview and step-by-step usage instructions for the repositories under the user `VDeep13` that are composed of Jupyter Notebooks. Each project typically involves data analysis, visualization, and modeling using Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## 1. Bright_Automotive-

**Purpose:**  
Analysis of automotive customer profiles and vehicle purchase trends.

**Contents:**
- `Bright_Automotive .ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all code, data cleaning, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and modeling.
- `bright_automotive_company - Copy.csv`: Dataset containing demographic and purchase information.

**How To Run:**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VDeep13/Bright_Automotive-.git
   cd Bright_Automotive-
   ```
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Bright_Automotive .ipynb"
   ```
3. Run each cell sequentially to perform data loading, cleaning, EDA, visualizations, and predictive modeling.

## 2. zomato

**Purpose:**  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization of Zomato restaurant data to derive insights about restaurant trends, ratings, locations, and cuisines.

**Contents:**
- Main Jupyter Notebook (e.g., `zomato_EDA.ipynb` or similar): Contains all code for loading and analyzing the Zomato dataset.
- Zomato dataset file (usually .csv): Restaurant data with attributes like name, location, rating, cuisine, price, etc.

**How To Run:**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VDeep13/zomato.git
   cd zomato
   ```
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Then open the main notebook (e.g., `zomato_EDA.ipynb`).
3. Execute cells in order to:
   - Load and clean data
   - Analyze restaurant features
   - Visualize trends (ratings, prices, locations, cuisines)
   - Summarize findings
